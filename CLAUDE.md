Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/`: daily code work
- `productivity/`: daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/`: kept around but rarely used, not promoted
- `in-progress/`: beta: public on purpose, feedback wanted, not shipped in the plugin
- `deprecated/`: no longer used

Every skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md` and an entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array (the Claude Code plugin ships exactly the promoted set). Skills in `misc/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear in either.

Install commands are copied verbatim from [.agents/install-block.md](./.agents/install-block.md). `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` makes the repo its own single-plugin marketplace (a fallback the install block explains, not the documented route). Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` after touching either manifest. Why a Claude plugin but not (yet) a Codex one lives in [.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md](./.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md).

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; non-promoted bucket `README.md`s (`misc/`, `in-progress/`) use a flat list.

Skills in `engineering/` and `productivity/` also have a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<skill-name>.md` (the docs tree mirrors those two bucket folders under `skills/`). The published URL is `https://aihero.dev/skills-<skill-name>` regardless of bucket: the docs path is repo organisation only. When you add, rename, or change the behaviour of a skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/`, create or re-sync its docs page following [.agents/writing-docs.md](./.agents/writing-docs.md). A finished page carries four sections: **What it does**, **When to reach for it**, **Common questions**, and **It's working if**. `writing-docs.md` holds the template, the section order, and where to hunt for the questions. Skills in the non-promoted buckets (`misc/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) get **no** docs page.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).

[`ask-matt`](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md) is the router that maps every user-reachable skill and how they relate. The same trigger that re-syncs a docs page applies to it: whenever you add, rename, remove, or change how a user-reachable skill fits the flows, re-read `ask-matt`'s `SKILL.md` and update it so the map stays accurate: a new skill it never mentions, or a stale one it still routes to, is a router that lies.

`scripts/check.sh` checks this repo's structural invariants: the rules stated above in prose that nothing else enforces. Run it before pushing, and after anything that adds, removes, renames, promotes, or demotes a skill. It reads and reports only, it reports every violation it finds in one run rather than stopping at the first, and it exits non-zero when it finds any. A check that cannot run because the machine lacks a tool reports itself skipped rather than passing quietly; `CHECK_REQUIRE_ALL=1` turns any skip into a failure, which is what CI wants. Rules are added alongside the work that makes them checkable, so it starts small and grows.

To (re)link the promoted skills into this repo's own harness skill directories (`.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, both gitignored), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. The links are scoped to this repo rather than to `$HOME` on purpose: this repo edits the skills themselves, so a machine-wide install would mean editing a skill silently changes how every other project on the machine behaves. The promoted set is read from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, so the non-promoted buckets are never linked. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so edits take effect immediately; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill, and it prunes links whose skill has been dropped or demoted.

No em-dashes anywhere in this repo's prose (`SKILL.md` files, docs, `README.md`, ADRs, code comments). Where a sentence reaches for one, rewrite it instead with a comma, colon, period, parentheses, or a conjunction, whichever the sentence actually wants; never do a blind character substitution.
